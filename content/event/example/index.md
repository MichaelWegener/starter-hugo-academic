title: A Two-Stage Research Performance Assessment of Turkish Higher Education Institutions
Using Data Envelopment Analysis and Beta Regression
abstract: In this paper, we study the research efficiency of the Turkish higher education sector in a
two-stage data envelopment analysis model with variable returns to scale. Using a sample of
50 private and public universities, the first stage of our model calculates the efficiency scores
and determines the reference set of efficient institutions for each inefficient university. DEA efficiency scores are a prime example of fractional data - a fact that has been disregarded by
many previous studies. Instead of popular Tobit regression which was developed for
censored data, we use beta regression for fractional data in the second stage of our analysis
to estimate the effects that external factors, such as age, size and ownership status of the
university, may have on efficiency scores. Our results indicate that research efficiency within
the Turkish system of higher education is relatively high: DEA scores range from 0.576 to 1,
with an average score of 0.878. We find 25 of the 50 universities in our sample to be research
efficient, with the maximum score of 1. Beta regression summary statistics suggest that extralarge universities tend to be less research efficient than large universities as the corresponding coefficient is statistically significant at the 10% confidence level. In turn, no statistically significant dependence on the research efficiency score is detected for ownership
status and age of the institution. Bootstrapped hypothesis testing further corroborates the
latter result.
