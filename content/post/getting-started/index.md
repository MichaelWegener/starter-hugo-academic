> Anything that just costs money is cheap.</p>
> — <cite>John Steinbeck</cite>

This is my first blog post ever, so the aim is just to play around and get familiar with this piece of software in general and the type-setting environment for mathematical formulas and equations in particular. As a first topic, I wanted to write a bit about a fundamental concept from microeconomics: the relationship between average and marginal costs. When do marginal costs exceed average costs? When do average costs exceed marginal costs? And where do average costs have their minimum?
As we will see, average costs are always minimised when they equal marginal costs. But here comes the proof...

Let us start with a general cost function $C(q)$, in which costs depend on the quantity produced $q$. Obviously, if we divide by $q$ we get average costs, i.e.
$$
AC=\frac{C}{q}.
$$
Likewise, if we take the first-order derivative, we get marginal costs or
$$
MC=\frac{\partial C}{\partial q}.
$$
But for which quantity produced are average costs decreasing? For which quantities are average costs increasing? Or put differently, for which quantity $q$ are average costs actually minimised? The answer is quite simple and straightforward: average costs are increasing if the first-order derivative for a particular quantity $q$ is positive and they are decreasing if the first-order derivative is negative. Needless to say, that the necessary condition for average costs to be minimised is given by the first-order derivative to equal zero.
