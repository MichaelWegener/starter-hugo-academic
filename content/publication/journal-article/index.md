abstract: In this paper, we analyse a variation of truel competitions in which
  each prospective player is represented by a node in a scale-free network.
  Without including any particular spatial arrangement of players, traditional
  game theory suggests that in many truel settings the strongest player often
  has the lowest probability of survival, a paradox that has been popularised by
  the term survival of the unfittest. However, both our single-run and the
  Monte-Carlo simulations suggest that this particular notion does not hold in
  scale-free networks. The spatial structure and arrangement of players are
  crucial for the outcome of truels, as in scale-free networks the number of
  players surviving the competition positively depends on their marksmanship
  (i.e., the strongest players indeed have the highest probability of survival).
