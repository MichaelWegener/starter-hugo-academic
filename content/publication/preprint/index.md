abstract: In this paper we study the research efficiency of the Turkish higher
  education sector in a two-stage DEA model with variable returns to scale. The
  aim of this paper is to benchmark or rank universities according to their
  research performance and to identify exogenous factors that may affect an
  institution’s efficiency score. DEA scores are a prime example of fractional
  data - a fact that has been disregarded by many previous DEA models which used
  popular Tobit regression for censored data in the second stage. Using a sample
  of 50 private and public universities, the first stage of our model calculates
  the efficiency scores and determines the efficient reference set for
  inefficient universities. In the second stage, we use beta regression and
  bootstrapped hypothesis testing to estimate the effects that external factors
  (age, size and ownership status) have on efficiency scores. We find that 27
  universities in our sample are research efficient. Beta regression summary
  statistics suggest that extra-large universities tend to be less research
  efficient than large universities (p<0.1), while both age and ownership status
  of the university do not have a statistically significant impact on an
  institution’s efficiency score. Test
